# Hey yall, I'm Sachin 

I am a software Engineer and a graduate in Electronics and Instrumentation. Currently based in Dublin, the city of Guinness and Craic and originally from Kerala, India.

I love working on any engineering problems from formula cars to writing "Hello,World" in Javascript. I am currently an [MLH](https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/open-source) 2021 Fellow :)
